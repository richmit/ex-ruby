#
#            The stock random number generator in Ruby is actually
#            quite good mathematically speaking.  It is even good
#            enough for semi-serious simulation work.  Unlike the
#            linear congruence generators typically found in many
#            languages, Ruby uses a version of the Mersenne Twister
#            with a period of around 2**19937-1.
#
#            WARNING: Before you go off and start writing simulation
#            code with Ruby's default generator, please check that
#            your version of Ruby still uses this generator or a
#            better one -- things change in the software world.


# First we will seed the generator to a nice, simple number.  Use an
# integer, but don't use 0.
