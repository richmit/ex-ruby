# Of course, Ruby also provides a non-block version of open, and a
# close method to go along with it.  In addition, we also have the
# expected rewind() and seek() methods too.  Finally, we have some
# gravy methods: pos, pos=, tell.

# Finally, one can create directories with Dir.mkdir(), and delete
# directories with any of unlink(), delete(), or rmdir().
