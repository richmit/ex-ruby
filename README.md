When I learn a new language, I write small programs exploring various
aspects of the language in question. I find this helps me to work out
the details of syntax, and firmly organize the material in my mind. On
this page are many of the little programs I wrote while learning Ruby
some time ago. I make a point of saying all of this because these
programs can, in no stretch of the imagination, be considered examples
of good Ruby form -- I wrote them while learning the language after
all. Still, they may be of helpful for people just learning the
language, and trying desperately to work out some detail... Use them
at your own risk!

You can read a bit more about these examples on my [home page](https://www.mitchr.me/SS/exampleCode/ruby.html).

Have fun!
