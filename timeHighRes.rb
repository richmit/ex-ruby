# @brief     High resolution timers in Ruby.@EOL
# @Keywords  ruby example time microsecond
# @Std       Ruby 1.8
#
#            Ruby provides reasonable access to micro-second counters
#            and sleeps. Micro-second resolution time data may be
#            accessed via the .usec or .tv_usec members of Time while
#            one second time may be accessed via .to_i or .tv_sec
#            members.  For sub-second resolution sleeps, simply
#            provide the sleep() method a floating point number.
#
#            Not all operating environments provide sub-second
#            resolution for time, so be careful.
