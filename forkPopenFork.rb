#
#            Ruby popen has a neat feature.  If the command is '-'
#            then another ruby interpreter is forked off and connected
#            to the current one via a pipe!  This is a very nice way to
#            fork off copies of the program and keep everyone in contact!

if(aPopenPipe = IO.popen('-', 'w+'))
  # This is the parent
  aPopenPipe.puts("PARENT SENT: Hello to my child")
  STDERR.puts("PARENT RECEIVED: '#{aPopenPipe.gets.chomp}'\n")
else
  # This is the child -- or the popen failed.
  STDOUT.puts("CHILD SEND: Hello to my parent!")
  STDERR.puts("CHILD RECEIVED: '#{STDIN.gets.chomp}'\n")
end
