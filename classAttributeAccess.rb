class Person
  def initialize(name, weight) # Constructor
    @name   = name
    @weight = weight
  end

  attr_reader :name, :weight
  attr_writer :weight

  ### The two lines above, are the same as doing the following:
  # def name
  #   @name
  # end
  # def weight
  #   @weight
  # end
  # def weight=(newWeight)
  #   @weight = newWeight
  # end

  # Note that "attr_accessor :weight" is the faster way to create
  # read/write attributes, and is the same as using "attr_reader
  # :weight" with "attr_writer :weight"

  # The following two methods provide access for a read/write "virtual
  # attribute".  This is a powerful technique, and common Ruby idiom!
  def weightKG
    @weight * 0.45359237
  end
  def weightKG=(newWeightKG)
    @weight = newWeightKG / 0.45359237
  end

end
