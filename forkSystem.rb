#
#            Ruby has a system() function very similar to the one in
#            Perl. As with Perl, the command output (STDOUT and
#            STDERR) escapes directly to the same STDOUT and STDERR
#            used by the Ruby script.  The good news is that all the
#            same shell redirection tricks available in Perl work with
#            Ruby too.

# true or nil (if the system call failed)..
result = system("ls")
if( !(result))
  print("Something went wrong!  Return code: #{$?}\n")
end

puts("The result: #{result.inspect}")
