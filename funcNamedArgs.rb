#            Ruby 1.8 doesn't really support named arguments like
#            lisp; however, a common idiom has arisen in the Ruby
#            community for doing something similar.  That idiom is to
#            pas a hash.  Most people name the hash argument 'params'.

def namedArgFunc(arg1, params)
end

# People generally call such a function like so:

namedArgFunc('foo', 
             { 
               'nameArg1' => 1,
               'nameArg2' => 2,
             })
